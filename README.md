Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs.
Design – Create architecture, UI, and database models.
Implementation (Coding) – Develop software based on design.
Testing – Identify and fix bugs, ensure quality.
Deployment – Release software to users or production.
Maintenance – Update, fix issues, and improve software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies**  

| Feature        | **Waterfall** | **Agile** |
|--------------|------------|--------|
**Approach** | Linear, sequential | Iterative, flexible |
**Phases** | Defined upfront, completed one at a time | Continuous development and feedback |
**Flexibility** | Rigid, changes are difficult | Adaptive, changes are easily incorporated |
**User Involvement**| Minimal until the end | High throughout development |
**Delivery** | Delivered as a full product at the end | Delivered in increments (sprints) |
**Risk Management** | Higher risk, late error detection | Lower risk, early problem detection |
**Best for** | Well-defined projects with stable requirements | Dynamic projects with evolving requirements |

When to Use Each

- Waterfall Example: Developing a medical device software that requires strict compliance, thorough documentation, and minimal changes.  
- Agile Example: Building a web or mobile app where user feedback is crucial, and features may change frequently.
